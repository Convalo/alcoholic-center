<p>If there ever was a silver lining with alcoholism, it would have to be the commonality of the alcoholic center due in large part to the commonality of alcoholism.</p>

<p>Of course by now we’ve heard of more elaborate drugs such as opioids and narcotics. Stuff that’s brought to us by boat, truck and car, or is made in highly explosive and toxic environments.</p>

<p>Alcohol, however is today made in the same way it has for hundreds of years. And alcohol’s availability since The Prohibition Period of the 1920s and 30s has made it one of the most accessible and easily addictive drugs on the legal market.</p>

<p>The problem with alcohol in our society is it’s everywhere.</p>

<p>It’s in restaurants, at parties, at sporting events, or just hanging around your nightly dinner table. And because alcohol is so prevalent in everyday life, it’s easy to take a vodka and tonic or whiskey and coke for granted.</p>

<p>Thing is, drinks like those can turn around on you, and before you know so, you’re addicted.</p>

<p>Sure, it seems unfair. </p>

<p>Even as alcoholism remains one of the oldest abusive substances in our history, so many other drugs with much more potency deserves the same, if not more scrutiny than alcohol.</p>

<p>Well, here’s the thing with that: Alcohol can also kill you. You can overdose on alcohol. Just like any other drug that has the potential to be harmful after long-term use, alcohol is no less detrimental, even if it is legal and regulated.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-remedy" class="anchor" href="#the-remedy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>THE REMEDY</h2>

<p>Look, whatever your views are on alcohol, its popularity, or whether or not it’s getting a bad rap as far as addictive qualities and potency is concerned, speculation flies out the window when you realize you may have a drinking problem.</p>

<p>Take hold of your issue now to avoid further damage in the future.</p>
